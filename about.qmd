Hey! I'm Sarah Pan, and I'm a sophomore at MIT. I love neural networks and reverse DCFs. This blog will host occasional writing about projects I've done. I'm also tangentially interested in books, markets (alternative ones), and treadmills.

Feel free to reach out on [Twitter](https://x.com/spantacular) or via email at [first name][last name]@mit.edu.
