I'm Sarah Pan. I work on AI/ML stuff and occasionally write about things I find interesting.

This blog is called "rabbitholes" because I tend to get sucked into random technical topics and spend way too much time exploring them.

Feel free to reach out on [Twitter](https://twitter.com) or [GitHub](https://github.com).
