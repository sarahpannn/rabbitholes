Hey! My name is Sarah Pan, and I'm a sophomore at MIT. I spend a lot of time thinking about neural networks and [reverse DCFs](https://public.gps100.com/). This blog will host occasional writing about projects I've done.

Feel free to reach out on [Twitter](https://x.com/spantacular) or via email at [first name][last name]@mit.edu.
